# Damage-Detection-on-Vehicles
Damage Detection on Vehicles is a deep learning project designed to automatically identify and classify damage in vehicle images. This repository provides an end-to-end solution—from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and inference—making it a valuable resource for applications in insurance, maintenance, and automated vehicle inspection.

## Overview
The project leverages modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect vehicle damage with high accuracy. Whether you're looking to develop an automated inspection system or enhance existing damage assessment workflows, this project offers a practical starting point along with reproducible code and examples.

## Features
- Automated Damage Detection: Detect and classify vehicle damage directly from images.

- Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean, augment, and prepare image datasets.

- Deep Learning Models: Example CNN architectures tailored for damage detection tasks.

- Evaluation Tools: Built-in metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model assessment.

- End-to-End Pipeline: From raw data ingestion to making predictions on new images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher

- Deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow — please refer to the requirements.txt for the exact package)

- OpenCV

- scikit-learn

- Other dependencies as specified in requirements.txt

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
`git clone https://github.com/avornhagen2/Damage-Detection-on-Vehicles.git
cd Damage-Detection-on-Vehicles
pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data Preparation
1. Download the Dataset:
Obtain a dataset of vehicle images containing both damaged and undamaged examples.

2. Organize the Data:
Place the dataset in the designated directory (e.g., ./data).

3. Preprocess the Data:
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the images for training:

bash
Copy
`python preprocess.py --data_dir ./data`

## Model Training
To train the damage detection model, execute the following command:

bash
Copy
`python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml`
Adjust hyperparameters and other settings via the configuration file as needed.

## Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model's performance on a test set using:

bash
Copy
`python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/model.pth --data_dir ./data/test`
Evaluation metrics and performance logs will be generated and saved in the results/ directory.

## Usage
Once trained, you can use the model for inference on new images:

bash
Copy
`python predict.py --image_path path/to/vehicle_image.jpg --model_path path/to/model.pth`
This script will output the predicted damage class along with confidence scores.

## Results
During training and evaluation, performance metrics and visualizations (such as confusion matrices) are generated. Check the results/ directory for detailed logs and plots that help assess model accuracy and reliability.
